# Open Source Process

## General Thoughts

### Goals
  - 100% open source code in GSA IT
  - Define open source code
  - Define a source code release process for all GSA IT teams to use to publicly publish code
  - Provide list of tools
  - Possibly provide matrix to walk through for teams to consider how to publish code
  - Determine proper licenses

### Process
  - What should GSA development teams do?
  - What is process for a team to get started?

  - Code review/scanning decoupled from A&A process
	  - Standing operations should have standard testing process
	  - Integrate code review into development process, part of code development process, needs to be accepted by development teams
	  - Create matrix of tools and key parties that can assist with code publishing
	  - Teams have to be committed to it
	  - Provide specific use cases - make sure we are not posting keys, PWs, sensitive content
