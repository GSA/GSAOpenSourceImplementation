# Privacy

GSA is committed to protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and submits agency reports to document our actions taken for a period of time. The Senior Agency Official for Privacy reporting requirement under the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) is completed in coordination with the Chief Information Security Officer. FISMA reports are submitted quarterly and annually. Agency System of Record Notices and Privacy Impact Assessments can be found on GSA.gov. The public can access GSA's privacy webpage for all questions related to PII.
