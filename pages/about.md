#### About

<p dir="ltr">This site outlines GSA's response to the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB's) <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_21.pdf" target="_blank">M-16-21</a> memo, Federal Source Code Policy: Achieving Efficiency, Transparency, and Innovation through Reusable and Open Source Software.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our current <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/GSAOSSPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">policy</a> outlines how we are realizing one of our GSA IT Vision elements of "Be Open."</p>  

<p dir="ltr">Besides the writing and posting of our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/GSAOSSPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">policy</a>, we have multiple efforts underway to implement it.</p>

    <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">We have a two mini-projects underway: 1.) automation of the OSS inventory to place on gsa.gov/code.json and open.gsa.gov/code.json; and, 2.) automation to review files within repositories for sensitive information before making the repository public and making private repositories that are found to have sensitive content until they can be cleaned.</p>

    <p dir="ltr">We are redesigning <a href="http://open.gsa.gov" target="_blank"> open.gsa.gov</a> including one of its major components, Code.  This is the theme of our upcoming <a href="http://open.gsa.gov/grace-hopper-hackathon/" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>.</p>
