# Websites

The GSA adheres to an internal web standard of continuous improvement with all of its digital products. The GSAâ€™s Enterprise Web Management team resides organizationally within the Office of Communications and Marketing and has a team of two usability professionals, a senior web analyst and an expert digital team who conduct testing on the top 100 pages of GSA.gov. Additionally, the agency performs constant audience satisfaction surveys on GSA.gov and scores a high rating from the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI). The ACSI survey also generates visitor comments about their experience using GSA.gov. Instant customer surveys designed to gather customer comments and feedback are also available on top microsites on GSA.gov. Metrics on website usage are gathered on a daily basis from WebTrends and Google Analytics tools with dashboards of progress posted for public view and comment.
