#### Welcome!

<p dir="ltr">This effort is brought to you by the GSA CTO's Office, GSA Digital Service.  We believe in being "open first" with working to realize 100% open source code across the Agency.  While we may be a little ways away from being fully 100% open source, we take pride in being the government (and industry) standard.</p>

<p dir="ltr">What we create is the people's code!  Likewise, what we do should be transparent and available to the public.</p>

<p dir="ltr">We will continually update this homepage with our current efforts to move to 100% open source.  Please let us know what you think. (<a href="https://github.com/gsa/gsaopensourcepolicy/issues/" target="blank">Discuss</a> | <a href="https://github.com/gsa/gsaopensourcepolicy/edit/master/pages/index.md" target="blank">Edit</a>)</p>

<p dir="ltr">Our current efforts are outlined below:</p>

<ol>
    <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">We are spreading our knowledge of Open Source Software (OSS) when possible with recently being asked to share our <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/GSAOSSPolicy.pdf" target="_blank">draft policy</a> with all CFO Act agencies.  Agencies are considering our policy as they develop theirs.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">We are leading a panel <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/downloads/OSCON2017Proposal.pdf" target="blank">submission</a> to the <a href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-tx" target="blank">O'Reilly Open Source Conference</a> in Austin in May.  We believe it is important to tell our story from a practical policy development and code implementation view.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li dir="ltr">
    <p dir="ltr">We are hiring a front-end developer and OSS Evangelist to join the GSA Digital Service team.  This new team member will lead OSS implementation across the Agency.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
