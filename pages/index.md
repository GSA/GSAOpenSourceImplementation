<h2>Open Government Plan 2016 - 2018</h2>

<p dir="ltr">Welcome to the Open Government Plan for the General Services Administration (GSA) for 2016-2018.

<p dir="ltr">While GSA updates the Open Government Plan at least every two years, our efforts to build more transparent, engaging and responsive programs both for citizens and other agencies grow each day. As a result, we are eager to hear your ideas and feedback each month here as our teams continue to report emerging programs and initiatives. Our fourth update to GSA's Open Government Plan, in the spirit of our open source commitment, forked this design from the <a href="https://github.com/usnationalarchives/opengovplan" target="_blank">National Archives and Record Administration's Open Government Plan</a>. Like the living document this approach allows our Open Government Plan to become, we look forward to honoring their open source contribution by further enhancing it with new features and capabilities for all agencies to benefit from. You can provide feedback through the following methods:</p>
