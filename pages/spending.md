# Spending Information 
The GSA built the initial version of USASpending.gov. In 2013, its management was moved to the Department of the Treasury. The GSA continues to submit spending reports to USASpending.gov as required. The GSA also created the Recovery.gov website, which was moved to the Recovery and Accountability Transparency Board.
