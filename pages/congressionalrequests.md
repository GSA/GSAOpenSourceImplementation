# Congressional Requests
The GSA’s congressional liaisons quickly respond to inquiries and report a variety of tasks that include preparing briefings for congressional hearings and handling phone calls, emails and written correspondence. Our Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs maintains an organization page on GSA.gov and provides online access to the Administrator’s Semiannual Management Reports, other congressional reports, and Congressional Requests.
