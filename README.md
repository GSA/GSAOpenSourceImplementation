# GSA Open Source Policy Implementation Guidance
(Alpha - further exploration to inform GSA IT teams how to publish code)

---

## Background
This repo was the initial site for GSA's development of it's open source code policy and implementation guidance.  That content can now be found at [open.gsa.gov/code](https://open.gsa.gov/code/).

## Purpose (a new one!)
The GSA Digital Service team in the Office of the CTO in GSA IT started a workgroup to develop process/tools for teams in GSA/GSA IT to use to publicly publish code.  Files associated with the outputs of this new workgroup can be found here for discussion with hopes of issues being created and pull requests being submitted.
